                    <img src="img/abt.jpg"><br>
                    E-Store was founded in October 2007 by Sachin Bansal and Binny Bansal, who were both alumni of the Indian Institute of Technology Delhi and formerly worked for Amazon. The company initially focused on online book sales with country-wide shipping. Following its launch, E-Store slowly grew in prominence; by 2008, it was receiving 100 orders per day.In 2010, E-Store acquired the Bangalore-based social book discovery service weRead from Lulu.com.

In late 2011, E-Store made several acquisitions relating to digital distribution, including Mime360.com and the digital content library of Bollywood portal Chakpak.

In February 2012, the company unveiled its DRM-free online music store Flyte. However, the service was unsuccessful due to competition from free streaming sites, and shut down in June 2013.

In May 2012, E-Store acquired Letsbuy, an online electronics retailer.In May 2014, E-Store acquired Myntra, an online fashion retailer, for ₹20 billion (US$280 million).Myntra continues to operate alongside E-Store as a standalone subsidiary; the site focuses on an upscale, "fashion-conscious" market, while E-Store itself focuses on the mainstream market and major international brands.

In February 2014, E-Store partnered with Motorola Mobility to be the exclusive Indian retailer of its Moto G smartphone.Motorola also partnered with E-Store on the Moto E—a phone targeted primarily towards emerging markets such as India. High demand for the phone caused the E-Store website to crash following its midnight launch on 14 May.E-Store subsequently held exclusive Indian launches for other smartphones, including the Xiaomi Mi3 in July 2014 (whose initial release of 10,000 devices sold out in around 5 seconds),the Redmi 1S and Redmi Note in late-2014 (which saw similarly accelerated sellouts),and Micromax's Yu Yunique 2 in 2017.

On 6 October 2014, in honour of the company's anniversary and the Diwali season,E-Store held a major sale across the service that it promoted as "Big Billion Day". The event generated a surge of traffic, selling US$100 million worth of goods in 10 hours. The event received criticism via social media over technical issues the site experienced during the event, as well as stock shortages.

In March 2015, E-Store blocked access to its website on mobile devices and began requiring that users download the site's mobile app instead. The following month, Myntra went further and discontinued its website on all platforms, in favour of operating exclusively through its app. The "app-only" model, however, proved to be unsuccessful for Myntra (reducing sales by 10%), and its main website was reinstated in February 2016. The experiment with Myntra led to suggestions that E-Store itself would perform a similar move, but this did not occur. In November 2015, E-Store launched a new mobile website branded as "E-Store Lite", which provides an experience inspired by E-Store's app that runs within smartphone web browsers.

In April 2015, E-Store acquired Appiterate, a Delhi-based mobile marketing automation firm. E-Store stated that it would use its technology to enhance its mobile services.In October 2015, E-Store reprised its Big Billion Day event, except as a multi-day event that would be exclusive to the E-Store app. E-Store also stated that it had bolstered its supply chain and introduced more fulfillment centres in order to meet customer demand.E-Store achieved a gross merchandise volume of US$300 million during the event, with the largest volumes coming from fashion sales, and the largest value coming from mobiles.

                    <h4>OUR HISTORY</h4>
In December 2015, E-Store purchased a minority stake in the digital mapping provider MapmyIndia. The company stated that it would licence its data to help improve delivery logistics.In 2016, E-Store acquired the online fashion retailer Jabong.com from Rocket Internet for US$70 million, as well as the UPI mobile payments startup PhonePe.In January 2017, E-Store made a US$2 million investment in Tinystep, a parenting information startup.

In April 2017, eBay announced that it would sell its Indian subsidiary eBay.in to E-Store and make a US$500 million cash investment in the company. eBay promoted that the partnership would eventually allow E-Store to access eBay's network of international vendors, and vice versa, but these plans never actually came to fruition.In July 2017, E-Store made an offer to acquire its main domestic competitor, Snapdeal, for around US$700–800 million. It was rejected by the company, which was seeking at least US$1 billion.
            
E-Store held a 51% share of all Indian smartphone shipments in 2017, overtaking Amazon India (33%).E-Store sold 1.3 million phones in 20 hours on 21 September alone for its Big Billion Days promotion, doubling the number sold on the first day of the event in 2016 (where it sold a total of 2.5 million phones in five days).

In August 2019, E-Store entered into a partnership with Authentic Brands to license and distribute Nautica in India.

E-Store has invested $4 million (about Rs 29 crore) in customer engagement and rewards platform EasyRewardz on Tuesday Nov 19 2019.

Acquisition by Walmart
On 4 May 2018, it was reported that the US retail chain Walmart had won a bidding war with Amazon to acquire a majority stake in E-Store for US$15 billion.On 9 May 2018, Walmart officially announced its intent to acquire a 77% controlling stake in E-Store for US$16 billion, subject to regulatory approval.Following the proposed purchase, E-Store co-founder Sachin Bansal left the company, while the remaining management now report to Marc Lore, CEO of Walmart eCommerce US.Walmart president Doug McMillon cited the "attractiveness" of the market, explaining that their purchase "is an opportunity to partner with the company that is leading transformation of eCommerce in the market".Indian traders protested against the deal, considering the deal a threat to domestic business.

In a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on 11 May 2018, Walmart stated that a condition of the deal prescribed the possibility that E-Store's current minority shareholders "may require E-Store to effect an initial public offering following the fourth anniversary of the closing of the transactions at a valuation no less than that paid by Walmart".

Following the announcement of Walmart's deal, eBay announced that it would sell its stake in E-Store back to the company for approximately US$1.1 billion, and re-launch its own Indian operations. The company stated that "there is the huge growth potential for e-commerce in India and significant opportunity for multiple players to succeed in India's diverse, domestic market." Softbank Group also sold its entire 20% stake to Walmart, without disclosing terms of the sale.

The acquisition was completed on 18 August 2018. Walmart also provided US$2 billion in equity funding to the company.

On 13 November 2018, E-Store CEO Binny Bansal resigned, after facing an allegation of "serious personal misconduct". Walmart stated that "while the investigation did not find evidence to corroborate the complainant's assertions against Binny, it did reveal other lapses in judgment, particularly a lack of transparency, related to how Binny responded to the situation."

On 25 March 2020, E-Store alongside Amazon announced that they are suspending all the services in India. The suspension happened as a result of the confusion over the details of the country's strict 21-days lockdown amid the 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic outbreak.[71]
